#### What's your favorite thanksgiving food?

Mine, personally, is the sweet potatoe casserole. Maybe it's a southern thing but those warm, sweet, fluffy potatoes blanketed under marshmallows make me a very happy lady. 

My friendsgiving, the 'friends only - no family drama' thanksgiving is just around the corner and we were trying to mitigate who was bringing what. I _of course_ volunteered to bring - ya guessed it - sweet potatoe casserole and green beans. As I'm writing this my candied pecans and marshmellows await their fate of being roasted in the oven. 

Now that you're in the third paragraph of this blog post you're probably thinking you clicked the wrong article. Let me quell your anxiety - you're on the right post. I think it might be easier to understand _why_ people and teams use CI and not just describe _what_ it is. 

So, back to friendsgiving - we're all trying to plan who is bringing what. This was the working list: 

> Jamie: pie
>
> Lisa: turkey
>
> The Smiths: ham
>
> Beks: sweet potatoes, green beans
>
> Lyn: mac'n'cheese, mashed potatoes

It was a screenshot we had in our group text to manage who was brinigng what. Now, I being myself invited another friend to friendsgiving and asked if they'd pitch in. I sent the screenshot letting them know what everyone else was bringing. They texted saying, "I'll bring a salad!" So then I went and texted the group chat, they're not in it ðŸ˜¬, and said my new friend was bringing a salad. 

Now, _another_ friend have invited someone else and that *new* person was bringing a salad. I receieved an updated version of the list which added new friend. 



> **Daniel: salad**
>
> Jamie: pie
>
> Lisa: turkey
>
> The Smiths: ham
>
> Beks: sweet potatoes, green beans
>
> Lyn: mac'n'cheese, mashed potatoes

Ugh, so now I have to go back to MY friend and let them know they should bring something else as 'salad' is already taken. Also, unless you're incredible at salads that _shouldn't_ be what you bring to a thanksgiving feast but I digress. Quickly I get a new text saying that's fine and they'll bring artisan bread and cranberry sauce. This gets approved by the group chat and we update the list as follows: 



> **Natalie: artisan bread, cranberry sauce**
>
> Daniel: salad
>
> Jamie: pie
>
> Lisa: turkey
>
> The Smiths: ham
>
> Beks: sweet potatoes, green beans
>
> Lyn: mac'n'cheese, mashed potatoes



Wow okay so that's our _final_ list and hopefully our Friendsgiving is a delicious feast. 

That was a bit of a headache to read and possibly follow along but I can only imagine that you or other friends _have_ at some point experienced this while trying to plan. Things can get messy real quick. Now imagine for a second that this is your large software application that is viewed by millions of people and instead of a handful of friends you have tens of developers all woring on this platform and making changes? That's the _problem_ that CI solves. 

We've got developers all making changes to a code base and checking against one anothers code to make sure that their builds and tests are passing properly. It organizes a system to work towards lean and healthy code - just like me after friendsgiving, lean and healthy ðŸ™ƒ. 

There are a lot of different tooling options for continous integration and this is the problem their trying to solve. Hopefully this enlightened you just a bit and also made you hungry!
