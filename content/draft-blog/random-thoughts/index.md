#### Thanks & Giving

I find it curious that almost every Thanksgiving post revolved around gratitude. Don't get me wrong, gratitude is quite important and a practice I encourage everyone to practice. But, if you look at the word 'thanksgiving' then one can see that thanks i.e. gratitude is only the first part. 

The second word, 'giving', tends to get lost in the day. I've talked about one of my values previously - Grace - but I failed to mention the other two: Gratitude and Giving.  

I live by those three values, Grace, Gratiude and Giving. Each one carries it's own meaning and is maleable with time as my understanding of those values change but they're anchored to one another in a way that is impentrable. One can not say they have grace if they are not grateful for as we understood in my previous post grace can only come from a place of gratitude. But we also can understand that those who are grateful will also give. You can't be grateful for what you have if you aren't ready to share what you got. 

Think of it this way - everything is a gift. Technically your life, your home, your kids, your job and even your pets are by products of a gift that you had some control over but not all. When we reflect on all of those things we are faced with a feeling of gratitude. We must understand the grace that we've been shown and the feeling of gratitude begins to swell. Once we feel that gratitude for the generosity we've been shown it's only natural to want to share that and give that feeling to another. 

How we give is up to you - my personal way of giving is always tipping high. Friends and family work in the service industry and quickly you learn that people can be awful to people serving them. I also believe that my tip helps that indivdiual in a very direct way as more money in their pocket. My parents on the other hand tithe (they also tip well) at their church. They believe their monetary means will make the most impact through their church. Now, they are older and have far more wealth than I so they give a lot to charities they're passionate about as well. However you give it's important to remember to do it from a genuine place. 

When we celebrate this holiday it's on us to look around and be thankful for what we have and where we're at in life. But when one is truly thankful they'll give it back. So this thanksgiving I urge your gratitude to not stop at the dinner table but to only begin there. That you'll take your gratitude and go and volunteer to help those who need it. 

My family is volunteering with Mobile Loaves & Fishes today to serve food. May we never lose site of gratitude and the deeper calling of being grateful.

#### Happiness Is Like Gravity



I think of happiness like gravity. It's always around - it's always present but we aren't always aware of it. In similiarity I think happiness is always around us yet we're just not aware of it. There are certain things that happen that make us more aware of gravity. If I pick up an apple and drop it we can see gravity doing its work to bring that apple to the ground. But if the apple is simply sitting on the counter we forget that it's _still_ gravity that's keeping it sitting on the counter. In the same vein happiness is sometimes forgotten until bigger moments. Maybe it's your dog running up to you with wagging tale, jumping on you and whining with joy to see you that reminds you how happy you are to have your dog. That happiness is still there when your pup is laying next to you on the couch - that happiness didn't go away it's just that you aren't aware of it. So, you might be wondering how do we become more aware of our happiness and the things that make us happy? Simple - gratitude. Gratitude anchors us to the moment and creates a small moment of reflection. When you're on your couch with your pup you look down at her and think of the moments with her that come to mind and you think, 'I'm so grateful for my dog'. You've taken a genuine moment to reflect on your dog and be grateful for her which in turn brought you happiness. When I'm upset at a friend or family member it's easy to forget how grateful and happy they've made you feel. So, I'll take a second and name 3 things I'm grateful for about that friend. This forces me to reflect on the qualities I love in that individual, the moments we've shared together and brings me out of my spiral of anger. Gratitude is an anchor for happiness. When we use it as a tool we'll become more aware of the people and things that bring us happiness and out of our negative spirals. I could go on and on about how powerful gratitude can be but if there's one thing I want to say is this: Happiness isn't something you'll get one day. Happiness isn't something to be chased. Happiness isn't a secret you're trying to uncover. Happiness is all around us but you must simply be present and reflective to notice it. It takes those moments of gratitude to remind you of the great moments, the cheeful moments to snap out of the darker ones. Joy is a necesity in our darkest moments but it's gratitude that will get you there.

#### Here's The Key To Success



If you're asking, "what is the key to success?", then you're not ready to be succesful. There is no 'key'. Why? Because if there were a 'key' then sucess is as easy and simple as unlocking a door and anyone who has ever been 'successful' wil tell you that's not true. If you're not ready to toil, work, fail and repeat - then you're not ready to be successful. No great individual woke up and found the key to becoming the great ___ that they became. I could go off on how our current culture is creating a fascade for younger folks to believe that somehow if the going gets tough it's not for them. If they fail at something then that wasn't really their 'passion'. If they don't get the dream job they applied for then that wasn't really their destiny. I fear for the future if we continue to promote and cultivate the idea that success is quick and easy. Success takes time and greatness grows from a foundation of failure.
