Docker is a contanerzation platform that allows you to easily to load your applications anywhere without worrying about the hardware. 

There are docker images - these a read only commands that build your application and apply the dependencies of your choosing. You can think about this like a recipe - a template of sorts. 

There are docker containers - this is where those images are executed and packaged nicely to be moved around as need be. 

There are registries - nope not bridal or baby - just a place where your images can live. Kind of like Instagram. 

There are lots of reasons people use Docker but the main reason people love docker is it's independence of hardware. Your application isn't going to worry about what hardware someone else is on as it's deterministic within its container. This allows freedom for application and dependencies for your images.
