Docker is a contanerzation platform that allows you to easily to load your applications anywhere without worrying about the hardware. 

There are docker images - these a read only commands that build your application and apply the dependencies of your choosing. You can think about this like a recipe - a template of sorts. 

There are docker containers - this is where those images are executed and packaged nicely to be moved around as need be. 

There are registries - nope not bridal or baby - just a place where your images can live. Kind of like Instagram. 

There are lots of reasons people use Docker but the main reason people love docker is it's independence of hardware. Your application isn't going to worry about what hardware someone else is on as it's deterministic within its container. This allows freedom for application and dependencies for your images.

Okay folklore and evermore are stuck in my head. I'm sorry did you just have the audacity to ask what those are??? They are taylor swift's latest albums. She surprised us in late July with `folklore` and then for her birthday she gave _us_ the gift of `evermore`. Can someone say Q U E E N?! So generous of her to bless our ears with lyrics and melodies that make us want to runaway from all our problems and join a coven!!! 

Docker?! Dock her? Doc tor ?? Not quite. But, I will say both of these albums are sister albums. If you listen closely you'll hear very similar themes throughout. Even their structure is quite similar with more pop hits towards the front of the album and slower tear inducing ballads towards the back. You could think of them as similar but not the same (yeaahh like siblings). This is what Docker does for you. Docker will take a read only image (Dockerfile) and create a container based off that image. Now you might be very confused because I am too. I don't think this taylor swift and docker comparison is going very well for me....

DOCKER DOCKER DOCKER WHAT THE FUCK IS A DOCKER???? it's a contanerzation platform that takes read only images and spins up containers based on that template. literally yeah that's it. sure, it can get more complicated but why shoudl we complicate something so simple?? docker is like a lunchable. you got the main ingredients and they can be transferred anywhere you want for lunch.



you can think of taylor swift as the operating system kernel and each of her albums as a 'container' running off that kernel. so sure, tim mcgraw sounds _nothing_ like ready for it -- EXCEPT -- they both were created and run off her briliant mind ğŸ˜Œ

virtual machines are bulky and like super hard to use BLEH don't use them 

taylor swift is _literally_ an operating systems kernel because she is 

you could think of the docker engine as taylor's writing utensil - it's how she communicates what's in her OS _into_ her albums

one could think of docker hub as `samplng` in music - the melody, or the arragnment already exists 

was Docker the first in the container industry? no. but there was napster before spotify, yahoo before google and myspace before facebook. docker like these examples modernized and popularized the practice of putting everything into containers



Docker is confusing because you hear about it a lot but no one really explains what it's doing or why it's so popular. Docker is a containerzation platform. It's not the first to do this but just like other big tech giants it popularized and modernized the practice. 

Here's a visual for what docker is doing

docker containers are like albums - each is going to have different songs - with different instruments, chords etc... 

but the actual docker aspect of it is that the ARTIST is what remains constant - i.e. the OS kernel

docker hub is like an a music store 

dockerfile (blueprint / song demo) --> docker image --> docker container
