description: What role does grace play outside of religiosity?

It's interesting to think about grace. As a young person who grew up in the religious sector grace was a common word and used at will by many. In a religious sense it's used to describe an act from a divine being. The idea that we as impure human beings need to be saved from our transgressions and that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins was the ultimate form of grace.

Now, I'm a bit older and this word has transformed its meaning in my life. Although I am still religious/spiritual grace as a word has been inundated as one of my core values.
Grace is difficult. Grace is not human. Grace, true perfect grace, is done in thankfulness. When we give grace, we must do so in gratitude. You cannot have grace for yourself if you are not grateful for what you have and where you are.


As I reflect on the hard moments of this year I am astounded by the amount of grace that I have shown myself and that others have shown me. When I begin to have negative self-talk or a low self-image I immediately think, "have grace for yourself Rebekah." But I can not fully and truly feel grace if I am not willing to be grateful and rejoice in where I am.
Grace accepts people for where they're at, not where they will go. Part of me is always trying to improve and help others improve. Previously I've coached so naturally I have this desire to see the people around me succeed and become better, as well as the person in the mirror.


But, I can't always be asking for others to be better. I can't always be trying to have myself be better. In most moments, in hard moments, in growth moments, I must instead accept the circumstance.


Accept where someone is. Accept myself exactly where I'm at. And the moment I do, the moment you can do that your posture turns towards gratitude. Grateful for the place you're at. Grateful for the moments that brought you here. Grateful for the past. And then, grace grows. You realize that that it's okay. Everything is alright.


The pain you felt, the anger that rose begins to be replaced by this unfathomable sense of grace. Grace is not forgiveness. Grace is not justice. Grace is acceptance of where someone's at with no desire to change anything at all.


> Grace is beautiful. Grace is needed. Grace is a gift.


So please, today and tomorrow when you want the world around you, the people around you or yourself to change maybe instead, _give grace_.
