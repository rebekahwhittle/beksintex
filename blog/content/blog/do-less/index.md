description: Productivity isn't about doing more, it's about doing less.

I keep seeing all of these articles about productivity.
Do 'this' to gain more time in your day. Do 'this' so you have time to do 'that'! Start doing 'this' to stop doing 'that'… blah blah blah.

Oh my god. Y'all.

> Rushing through life only gets you to your grave faster.

I'm going to offer the exact opposite of all of those productivity hacks. Instead of trying to squeeze more into your day, start squeezing things out of your day.
Yeah, you heard me. **Start doing less**.

Our lives are beautiful. They're all different and they're all important. How we live them is 100% up to you. You get to decide how to live, but please know, you only get 1 life. You get to do this beautiful journey once.

Let me also remind you of the truth that we love to ignore - you're going to die.

I'm going to get morbid and make you face the absolute hard truth. Your beautiful life will end. To make this harder, the incredible humans around you, well, their lives will end too.

##### My first experience with death was when a good friend of mine lost a hard fought battle to cancer. I was 12.

Twelve years later and I've experienced multiple losses of beautiful, wonderful people whom I touched, was near and loved. After each of their deaths, not once did people ask how much they accomplished, how productive they were or what app they used to do more. No, their time was gone. No app was going to give their family and friends more time with them.

As I grappled with their loss, I never thought about how I could do more or start becoming more productive in my life. Instead, the opposite occurred. I began to slow down. I'm only 24, but I've started to say 'no' to things, do less, and be more present. The only thing I've learned is that I want to enjoy my life. I don't want to rush through it. I don't want it to pass me by. I want to fully embrace it and all of its moments.

There are a lot of things I could say about how productivity is a millennial ideology, or how productivity is just the greed of time disguised as a superior goal. But, if you want more time, you need to stop doing so much. If you want to feel like you're living your life fully, embrace leisure, be present and figure out your values and then anchor yourself to them.

When you take something out you don't have to replace it with something 'more productive'. For example, I don't have socials on my phone and I almost never use them in any capacity,but I don't replace that time with work. Instead, I'll go for a walk, listen to an album, chat or hang with a friend. I replace that time with leisure activity, not productivity.

Although I do love coding, reading, and learning, there is a time for it but there is also a time for play. Slow down and find the ease that life can bring. You don't have to rush through everything to be more 'productive'.

##### Learn to enjoy. Learn to slow down. Learn to do less.

Hopefully you'll start to find a joy in your life you've never felt.

Maybe that underlying vibration of anxiety will start to fade. Maybe you'll start to look at the things around you with more appreciation. Maybe you'll start to notice how the deep greens of trees contrast with the indigo sky. Maybe you'll start to watch your cat and dog play and laugh about it. Maybe, slowly, you'll notice that your phone isn't around you and you're 100% okay with it. Maybe you'll stop to chat with strangers and hear their stories.

Maybe, your pride of being 'too busy' and 'productive' will dissipate, and just maybe, you'll start to lead a life you enjoy.

I bet a lot of you will read this, think, "Good idea, but I don't have time" and rush on to read the next article about a productivity hack that will help you do more. And that is totally okay. This will take time to learn and implement. I have a lot of grace and patience for you and myself as we become better stewards of the lives we have.

It's taken me 12 years (and i'm still learning) to implement this little secret of doing less, but once you do, it'll change your life _forever_.
